Here\\'s how you can improve it:\\n\\n### Improvements to Make the Feedback More Actionable and Structured:\\n\\n1. **Title or Summary to Contextualize Feedback:**\\n   - Begin with a brief overview or statement of purpose to clarify what the feedback addresses, e.g., \"Feedback on Dashboard Workflow and Use of LookML.\"\\n\\n2. **Actionable Points:**\\n   - Break down the feedback into clearly defined action items. For example:\\n     - \"Ensure PR readiness by...\"\\n     - \"Discuss alternatives for maintaining dashboards over time.\"\\n     - \"Explore the feasibility of using User-Defined dashboards for more flexibility.\"\\n\\n3. **Specific Examples:**\\n   - Provide a specific example of how an issue affected the project, e.g., \"This caused delays in project X because...\". This contextualizes the feedback and underscores its importance.\\n\\n4. **Suggestions for Improvement:**\\n   - Instead of just stating what didn\\'t work, provide a solution or a suggestion for improvement. For example, \"Consider using process Y instead of process Z for future projects.\"\\n\\n5. **Positive Notes:**\\n   - Acknowledge what worked well to balance the feedback. For example, “It\\'s great to see the file is clean and ready for deployment.”\\n\\n6. **Encouragement of Collaboration:**\\n   - Suggest how team collaboration could be improved, e.g., \"I suggest scheduling a team meeting to discuss these insights further.\"\\n\\n7. **Clarify Consequences and Benefits:**\\n   - Explain the potential impacts of not implementing changes, e.g., \"Continuing with the current workflow could lead to increased maintenance efforts.\"\\n\\n8. **Focus on Constructive Outcomes:**\\n   - Center feedback around constructive outcomes, like \"By adopting this approach, we could reduce future workload by X%.\"\\n\\n### Ranked Feedback (Scale of 1-10):\\n\\nI would rank this feedback as a **6**. Here\\'s why:\\n\\n- **Clarity (5/10):** The message is complex and includes valuable insights, but lacks clarity and order. The feedback could benefit from a more structured approach to make it easier to understand and act upon.\\n  \\n- **Actionability (5/10):** The feedback provides some suggestions but is not broken down into actionable, step-by-step guidance, which reduces its effectiveness.\\n\\n- **Detail and Depth (8/10):** It\\'s comprehensive and provides an in-depth perspective, but some details can be streamlined for better focus.\\n\\n- **Encouragement of Dialogue (6/10):** Though it invites discussion, it could be more proactive in suggesting specific next steps for team collaboration.\\n\\nBy refining the structure and making the points more actionable, the feedback could be more effectively implemented and understood by all team members.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)\n"
